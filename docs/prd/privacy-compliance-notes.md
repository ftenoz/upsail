# Privacy & Compliance Notes
- Store only necessary PII for identity and communication (name, email, contact details).
- Avoid storing sensitive data beyond certifications and professional history unless required.
- Default data retention: keep inactive accounts and messages for 12 months unless deletion requested.
- Assume initial deployment in a single jurisdiction; revisit compliance needs as regions expand.
