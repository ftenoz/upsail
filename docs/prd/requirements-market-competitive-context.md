# Requirements## Market & Competitive Context
- Maritime expert hiring is dominated by informal networks (referrals, WhatsApp, phone) rather than structured platforms.
- Generic freelancer marketplaces lack domain-specific trust signals (certifications, availability, maritime experience) and feel risky for corporate users.
- The MVP differentiator is a narrow, professional workflow that emphasizes credibility and reduces perceived liability.
