# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary
- Overall PRD completeness: ~90%
- MVP scope appropriateness: Just Right
- Readiness for architecture phase: Ready
- Most critical gaps: stakeholder alignment and detailed UX flow/error handling (optional for architecture start)

## Category Analysis Table
| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PARTIAL | User research evidence still thin; impact not quantified |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PARTIAL | Out-of-scope rationale not explicitly documented |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PARTIAL | Missing error states and IA/navigation detail |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PARTIAL | No explicit feature priorities or dependencies |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PARTIAL | Compliance/privacy specifics still light |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PARTIAL | Dependencies not documented; local testability not specified |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PARTIAL | Limited trade-off rationale and monitoring detail |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Integrations remain unspecified |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PARTIAL | Stakeholders and approval/comms plan missing |

## Top Issues by Priority
BLOCKERS
- None

HIGH
- Add stakeholder/approval alignment section (even minimal).
- Add feature dependency notes (can be brief).

MEDIUM
- Add error-state expectations for critical flows.
- Clarify compliance/privacy expectations (jurisdictions, retention).

LOW
- Add out-of-scope rationale and competitive/user research sources if available.

## MVP Scope Assessment
- Potential cuts: Admin safeguards could be deferred if timeline pressure emerges.
- Missing essentials: Stakeholder alignment and dependency notes.
- Complexity concerns: Messaging and role-based flows remain core but manageable.
- Timeline realism: Achievable if scope remains lean.

## Technical Readiness
- Constraints and data model are clear enough to proceed.
- Technical risks are noted; privacy requirements should be validated.
- Architecture can begin with current assumptions.

## Recommendations
- Add a brief stakeholder/approval section.
- Add dependencies between epics and key stories.
- Keep privacy retention assumptions visible and revisit as region expands.

## Final Decision
READY FOR ARCHITECT: The PRD is sufficient to start architecture, with minor additions recommended.
