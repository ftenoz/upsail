# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A professional, trust-oriented interface that feels like an internal tool: minimal, clear, and focused on getting to a qualified conversation quickly. The UI should reduce perceived risk with explicit role clarity, disclaimers, and a calm, corporate tone�no startup gimmicks.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Role-based onboarding (Company vs Freelancer) with clear expectations
- Simple, linear job posting and application flows
- Structured profiles that surface credibility signals (certifications, availability, LinkedIn)
- Shortlist/reject as primary triage actions
- Message-first engagement with a clean, inbox-style UI
- Admin removal controls designed to be unobtrusive but accessible

## Core Screens and Views
- Landing page (trust-oriented explanation + disclaimers)
- Auth + role selection
- Company dashboard
- Job posting flow
- Job detail + applicant list
- Freelancer profile (public + edit)
- Job feed with filters
- Application view
- Messaging inbox + thread
- Basic admin panel (users/jobs)
