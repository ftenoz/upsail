# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Validate demand by enabling a real company to post a job and initiate a real conversation with a qualified maritime expert within 30 days
- Deliver a trust-oriented, low-risk workflow for posting, applying, shortlisting, and messaging in a narrow maritime context
- Provide a professional, domain-specific profile and job structure that improves visibility and credibility over ad-hoc networking
- Keep scope lean (no payments, ratings, subscriptions, or AI matching) to optimize for speed-to-learning and manual ops

## Background Context
Maritime companies currently source short-term experts through informal networks, WhatsApp groups, and phone calls, which is slow, opaque, and difficult to scale. Generic freelancer platforms don�t meet the trust, certification, and professional expectations of this industry. A focused marketplace can reduce sourcing friction by structuring profiles, jobs, and messaging around maritime-specific needs while keeping the experience minimal and corporate-friendly.

The MVP�s purpose is narrow: prove that a company is willing to post a job and engage a qualified stranger through a simple, trusted platform. Anything that doesn�t directly contribute to that outcome is intentionally out of scope.
