# Story 1.2: Landing page with trust messaging and scope disclaimers

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** a clear landing page that explains the platform purpose and limitations,
**so that** I can understand the value and risk boundaries before signing up.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.2.1: Landing page states the platform's purpose and target users.
1.2.2: Landing page includes explicit disclaimers (no payments, no guarantees).
1.2.3: Landing page provides clear paths for Company and Freelancer sign-up.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Update the public landing page content to explain purpose + target users (AC: 1.2.1)
  - [x] Replace the canary copy with purpose and target audience messaging on `app/(public)/page.tsx` [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
  - [x] Use Tailwind/Radix UI styling per the UI stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- [x] Task 2: Add explicit disclaimers to the landing page (AC: 1.2.2)
  - [x] Include "no payments" and "no guarantees" copy in a visible disclaimer section [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
- [x] Task 3: Add Company and Freelancer sign-up CTAs (AC: 1.2.3)
  - [x] Add two distinct CTA buttons linking to `/auth/register` labeled for Company and Freelancer [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- [x] Task 4: Add landing page tests (AC: 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3)
  - [x] Add a unit test under `apps/web/tests/pages` covering purpose text, disclaimers, and CTA labels/links [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
  - [x] Use Vitest + React Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights:** Monorepo baseline is in place and the public landing route already exists at `apps/web/src/app/(public)/page.tsx` with a canary page. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- **Data Models:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
- **API Specifications:** No API calls required for the landing page; do not fetch directly in components. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Component Specifications:** Use App Router and consider extracting reusable UI sections into `apps/web/src/components` if helpful. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
- **File Locations:** Update `apps/web/src/app/(public)/page.tsx`; place any new UI building blocks under `apps/web/src/components` as needed. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]
- **Testing Requirements:** Add a unit test under `apps/web/tests/pages` for the landing page content. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Technical Constraints:** Next.js 14 + Tailwind + Radix UI; service layer only for API calls (none expected here). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table, architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Project Structure Notes:** Align with the unified monorepo layout and public route under `app/(public)/page.tsx`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Edge Cases:** Copy should remain clear and readable on mobile; CTAs should remain visible without requiring auth. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

### Testing
- **Frameworks:** Vitest + React Testing Library. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Locations:** `apps/web/tests/pages`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Pattern:** Unit test that asserts purpose text, disclaimers, and CTA link labels/hrefs. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]
